### B. Eng, MSc. Ph.D. (C)

As a researcher in development with a Master in Engineering and an on-course Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering, over five years of experience in writing and editing scientific articles, book chapters, grant applications, high resolution presentations and posters among others, I am a passionate about high-quality, rapid and accurante writing as well as editing services in a vast variety of domains.

I am also passionate about explaining and telling scientific stories, to help researchers spread significant knowledge. Among the things I have realized within the last years is that students, scientists, and professionals in general are often not provided with sufficient opportunities to exploit the writing skills required to turn important data into interesting stories. 

If you want to be rather at the bench than line-by-line editing, then send your manuscript to me!

I can work with Spanish, English, Portuguese and French speakers. I will help you to overcome language barriers which can significantly reduce the impact and reach of your report.

### My Services

I offer copyediting, proofreading, style corrections, line-by-line editing, increasing quality of diagrams and images, comprehensive and developmental editing and writing.
