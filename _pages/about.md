### B. Eng, MSc. Ph.D. (C)

As a researcher in development with a Master in Engineering and an on-course PhD in Electrical Engineering, over four years of experience in writing and editing scientific articles, book chapters, grant applications, high-resolution presentations and posters among others, I am a passionate about high-quality, rapid and accurate writing as well as editing services in a wide variety of domains.

I am also passionate about explaining and telling scientific stories to help researchers spread significant knowledge. Among the things I have realized within the last years is that students, scientists, and professionals, in general, are often not provided with sufficient opportunities to exploit the writing skills required to turn important data into interesting stories.

If you want to be rather at the bench than line-by-line editing, then send your manuscript to me!

I can work with Spanish, English, Portuguese and French speakers. I will help you to overcome language barriers which can significantly reduce the impact and reach of your report.
