<b>"JD helped us to rewrite the results of a dense investigation with clear and elegant words. He help us to turn our initial work into a detailed, organized and correctly exposed paper. Juan contributed with precision and solidity in writing. The team learned a lot from their contributions, and we got a better grasp about writing skills thanks to their interventions."</b><br><br>

<b>"I have been working with Juan during my undergraduate thesis. I had the opportunity to work with him writing conference papers and he always improved the quality of our articles, he knows and uses properly the technical language of each topic, his adjustments are accurate and he completes the work very quickly. Is always a placer to work with him, because he does his best every time. "</b><br><br>

<b> Juan was a great support in the development of my undergraduate thesis, he helped me to improve the presentation of my findings through the use of SWOT and CPM matrices as tools that facilitated the presentation of qualitative strategies that needed a quantitative representation to get a better understanding. </b><br><br>
