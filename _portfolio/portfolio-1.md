<b>"Juan helped us to rewrite the results of a dense investigation with clear and elegant words. He help us to turn our initial work into a detailed, organized and correctly exposed paper. Juan contributed with precision and solidity in writing. The team learned a lot from their contributions, and we got a better grasp about writing skills thanks to their interventions."</b><br><br>
